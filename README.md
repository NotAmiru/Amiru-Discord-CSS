This file is made with myself in mind as it's what I wanted and liked, so some of this may or may not be to your liking however, this can be customised to your liking. <br>

Most snippets included can be found in the [Official Vencord Server](https://discord.gg/E5qGbcTX). <br>

**NOTE**: None of these snippets are made by me so I am not responsible for if they break and I can't promise that I will be able to help fix them.
